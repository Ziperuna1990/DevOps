# DevOps
This solution ensures an efficient and secure hybrid infrastructure in AWS, combining on-premises resources with cloud services to achieve greater flexibility, scalability, and high availability. All stages are automated using Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and Ansible for configuration management. Modern CI/CD tools and container orchestration are utilized to streamline application delivery. The system supports confidentiality and security through the implementation of TLS for encrypted communications, IAM roles for fine-grained access control, and Vault for managing sensitive information, such as database credentials and API keys.

Hybrid Infrastructure: The infrastructure spans across on-premises resources (VPC #1) and cloud-hosted services (VPC #2), with secure communication established between the two via VPC peering. The on-premises simulation enables the testing of cloud services in an environment mimicking real-world data center operations, ensuring consistency when transitioning workloads.

Scalability & High Availability: The architecture supports autoscaling for EC2 instances, and high availability is achieved by leveraging multi-AZ deployments for critical services like RDS and Elasticache. A load balancer is used for API traffic distribution, ensuring reliability during peak loads. For database and caching systems, automated backups and multi-availability zone configurations enhance durability and fault tolerance.

Automation with Terraform & Ansible: Infrastructure provisioning is handled by Terraform, providing a consistent and repeatable environment across various stages (Dev, QA, Staging, Production). With separate configurations for each environment, the system can be easily adapted to changing requirements. Ansible automates server and application configuration management, ensuring consistency and reducing manual intervention.

CI/CD Pipeline: Jenkins automates the process of building and deploying Docker containers, with a focus on continuous integration and deployment. This pipeline builds the Flask API image, pushes it to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub or AWS ECR), and deploys it using Nomad for container orchestration. Consul is employed for service discovery, ensuring that services are dynamically registered and healthy, while Vault secures application secrets.

Security: Security best practices are enforced at every level:

TLS ensures encrypted communication between services, preventing eavesdropping and data tampering.
IAM roles and Security Groups tightly control access to resources, allowing only authorized services and users to interact with sensitive data.
Vault is used for secrets management, securely storing API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information.
Monitoring & Alerts: Basic monitoring is implemented using tools like Prometheus/Grafana or AWS CloudWatch, tracking key metrics such as system resource usage (CPU, memory) and application health. Alerts are configured to notify stakeholders of critical events, such as high CPU usage or application downtime, enabling timely intervention.

Multiple Environments: The Terraform configuration can be extended to handle multiple environments (Development, QA, Staging, Production) by leveraging different workspaces or configurations. This enables the same infrastructure code to be reused across environments, with slight modifications to meet the specific needs of each.

This approach provides a highly automated, secure, and scalable solution that bridges the gap between on-premises and cloud infrastructure while ensuring continuous delivery and operational efficiency.
